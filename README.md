=================

Personal work for the course Computer Graphics in Aalto University.

The repository contains exercises from two different iterations of the course. In the year 2011 the course assignments were small programming assignments done in Processing. The programming assignments varied from algorithm implementations such as the Welzl's algorithm to implementing small games.

On 2012 the course shifted to C++ and OpenGL. The programming assignments were specific tasks such as skinning and ray tracing. The assignments took advantage of the framework provided by the course staff.
